# Python
This app was the final exam for the Python stack at Coding Dojo and received a perfect 10/10. 

The exam was a timed exam that consisted of making a login and registration with verifications. Users can add new trips or join other users' trips. 

Grading was based entirely on functionality and logic, not styling. Basic styling was done with twitter bootstrap.
